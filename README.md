What is this repo ?

This is the sourcecode of CrystalAC, a premium product that buy for 10 US Dollars on Polymart - https://polymart.org/resource/crystalac-foxspigot-1-8-8.1403



Why this is being released ?

The full anticheat is actually skidded, it's basically reaperacx but with more skidded checks.



How can i know if it is really skidded ?

Just compare code of it with src of Verus/AGC, for example some range checks are skidded from AGC
