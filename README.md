This is the sourcecode of CrystalAC, a premium product that you can buy for 10 US Dollars on Polymart - https://polymart.org/resource/crystalac-foxspigot-1-8-8.1403

**Why this is being released ?**

The full anticheat is actually skidded, it's basically reaperacx but with more skidded checks.

**How can i know if it is really skidded ?**

Just compare code of it with src of Verus/AGC, for example some range checks are skidded from AGC
